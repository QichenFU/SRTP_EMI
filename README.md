# SRTP_EMI

In this project, I first performed a practice single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis of Ayyaz et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1154-y). Then, I did the analysis of scRNA-seq data of lung cancer tissue (Kim et al, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16164-1) to find cancer stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal intermediate (EMI) cells.
